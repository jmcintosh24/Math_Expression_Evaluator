# Math_Expression_Evalutor
This project evaluates an entered math expression properly using order of operations. Stacks and Queues are used in order to efficiently carry out the order of operations. A testing file is also included with a plethora of J-Unit tests. This project was worked on with a partner in a Data Stuctures class.
